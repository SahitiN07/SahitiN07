## 🚀 About Me  

I’m a **Data & AI Engineer** passionate about designing scalable data systems and intelligent AI workflows that transform information into actionable insights.  
Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Information Systems at Northeastern University**, I bring a blend of **data engineering expertise, machine learning knowledge, and AI-driven system design** to every project I take on.  

At **Accenture**, I engineered **large-scale ETL pipelines** across **AWS and GCP**, automated workflows using **Airflow and Talend**, and developed **real-time Power BI dashboards** that optimized business performance.  
At **Humanitarians AI**, I focus on building **multi-agent AI systems** that combine **LLMs, financial APIs, and market data** to deliver research intelligence for asset managers.  

My work spans **data pipelines, RAG systems, LLM fine-tuning**, and **AI-powered document exploration**, merging engineering precision with creative problem-solving.
